1. Write a program to print numbers from 1 to 10.
2. Write a program to calculate the sum of first 10 natural number.
3. Write a program to find the factorial value of any number entered through the keyboard.
Example: !5 = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5.
In this example please don't confuse the factorial sign (!) used in math with the negate operator.

4. Write a program that reads a set of integers, and then prints the sum of the even and odd integers.

5. Write a program that prompts the user to input a positive integer. It should then print the multiplication table of that number.
6. Two numbers are entered through the keyboard. Write a program to find the value of one number raised to the power of another.
7. Write a program to display a pattern like a right angle triangle with a number.
Example:
1
12
123
1234

8. Write a program that prints the product of the first n odd natural numbers.
Example:
1 * 2 * 3 etc...

9. Write a program to make such a pattern like a right angle triangle with a number which will repeat a number in a row.
Example:
1
22
333
4444

10. Write a program that displays the first n square numbers and their sum.
Example: 1 4 9 16 etc...

11. Write a program to check whether a given number is a 'Perfect' number or not.
The sum of its divisors is equal to the number itself excluding the number.
Example: 6
Divisors: 1, 2, 3
Sum of Divisors: 1 + 2 + 3 = 6;

12. Write a program to find the 'Perfect' numbers within a given number of ranges.

13. Write a program to print Fibonacci series of n terms where n is input by user:
Example:
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 24 .....
